# CPE 487 -- Digital System Design
## Assignment 1: VHDL Modeling
1. Find a VHDL model not included in the course material
2. Add a comment citing the source
3. Upload the VHDL file to the GitHub repository
 

Program Outcome 1: (Complex Problem Solving)

2.1 The student will be able to apply VHDL entity/architecture modeling to represent component inputs and outputs and also internal signals, variables, and operations.

### Submission: [assignment1.vhd](./assignment1.vhd)
# Assignment 2
Program Outcome 2: (Design)
2.5 The student will be able to write test vectors for a digital system and develop a VHDL test-bench to apply these vectors using file based input/output operations.

1. Develop a test bench for a design in VHDL 
2. Add a comment citing the source
3. Run GHDL to generate a VCD file
4. Use GTKWave to view the VCD file and take a screen shot
5. Upload the design, test bench, and VCD files to the GitHub repository
6. Create a README.md to include the screen shot
## Half Adder Function
### Submission: [assignment1.vhdl](./assignment1.vhdl)
### GTKWave VCD File
